# E-Learning-Platform
## Description
This web-based project revolves around making education more accessible and easier to individual needs. We aim to create a user-friendly platform that accommodates users' schedules and offers convenience for time management. Our goal is to offer a wide range of courses based on users' interests, including video lectures, quizzes, and assessments, along with practical tasks to enhance understanding and feel free to ask questions from students.
The platform will cater to two main types of users: students and teachers. Students can easily register for courses, and our system will recommend suitable courses based on their preferences by taking input from the students. Additionally, we prioritize security for user data and course information. To ensure a seamless experience, we provide two distinct dashboards for users upon login.
Our website's interface will be designed with user-friendliness in mind, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning experience. We are committed to making education accessible and engaging for all users.
